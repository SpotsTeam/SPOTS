An Application that assists you with parking","body":"### Welcome to SPOTS.\r\nAbout Spots\r\n\r\nHave you ever attended an event (football game, concert, festival) and tried to avoid high parking prices by parking in residential or commercial lots for sale near the event location? If this is you, then Spots is the app you need to pursue.\r\n\r\nSpots is a web and mobile app that will help you to find a parking spot at any event in your area. Spots does this through the help of you, the user. As the user of this app, you can register as both a homeowner and a driver. As a homeowner, you indicate how many spots you have available in your lot. This information is readily available to users if they search for an event in your area. As a driver, you register your car and you can reserves spots at a lot before the game as well as pull up the app on game day to find which homes have parking spaces available.\r\n\r\nType in IP Address (52.10.141.9)\r\nTo Search for an event, type in the search box for an event near you\r\nTo learn more about Spots, click the about SPOTS button in the top right\r\nTo Sign in, click the sign in button\r\nOnce you click the sign in button, you can sign in as a driver or homeowner.\r\nOnce you click driver or homeowner, fill in your information\r\n\r\n```\r\nIP: 52.10.141.9\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
